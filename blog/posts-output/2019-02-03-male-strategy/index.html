    <h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>There are two reasons for this post. Firstly, in talking to some biologists, I found there is a lot of interest in learning game theory but little useful material to learn from. Most material published on this topic reminds me of the "How to Draw an Owl" meme: one category of books teaches readers how to draw simple circles, while another, different category of material is full of beautiful finished pictures of owls, with no intermediate cases.</p><p>Secondly, I have written about frequency-dependent sexual selection in a <a href='http://localhost:3000/blog/posts-output/2019-01-15-seger-paper/'>previous post</a>, and find that frequency-dependent phenomena are becoming a recurrent theme of this blog. I believe they are responsible for some of the biggest blind spots in how we think about the world. Why would people vote for presidential candidate X when his candidature was completely unthinkable just a few years back? Why would history change direction when it flowed in a seemingly straightforward fashion for over eighty years? Why would technology Y linger in obscurity for over a decade, then experience a rapid surge in adoption within just two years? Why would certain cultural trends arise and then die just as mysteriously?</p><p>Sometimes we encounter folk explanations of such dynamics. You may have heard the saying "good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, hard times create strong men, strong men create good times." If you ever had the misfortune of mentioning it to a friend from academia, you would have discovered that the current academic culture is extremely averse to folk explanations of any kind (they are assumed to be false by default). The academia demands a <i>theory</i>. If you do not have a theory, nobody will believe you that the sun will rise tomorrow morning, no matter how many times it happened in the past. Of course, you could steal some makeshift theory from a philosophy book, such as that there is a certain dialectic to history, a sequence of thesis-anithesis-synthesis if you will. But this way of talking simply obscures the problem. What even <i>is</i> dialectic? Can one walk outside and point to it?</p><p>In my view, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary&#95;game&#95;theory'>evolutionary game theory</a> provides either a good way to model some of these dynamics, or at least a way to make mental pictures when more accurate models are not available. The word "evolutionary" should not scare you, however, if you are interested in human societies, since the relevant learning process can occur not only on genetic substrates but also on cultural ones.</p><p>As usual, the Mathematica notebooks for this post are available from <a href='https://github.com/LocusOfCtrl/notebooks'>this repository</a>.</p><h3 id="the&#95;strange&#95;case&#95;of&#95;a&#95;three-colored&#95;lizard">The Strange Case of a Three-Colored Lizard</h3><h4 id="motivating&#95;example">Motivating Example</h4><p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common&#95;side-blotched&#95;lizard'>side-blotched lizard</a> is native to western US and northern Mexico. The male lizards come in three color morphs: orange, yellow, and blue. The morphs are genetically determined with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. The gene is pleiotropic and affects the color of the male's throat and as well as behavior. The orange males are ultra-aggressive, defend large territories, and are polygynous. Their lifespan is significantly shortened either due to their extreme lifestyle or due to other effects of the gene. The yellow males are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual&#95;mimicry'>female mimics</a> and their strategy is that of a "sneaky copulator." They invade territories of orange males and deflect the aggression of the proprietors by performing female rejection ritual. Finally, the blue males tend to be monogamous and engage in intensive mate guarding on a smaller territory compared to orange males.  Due to their vigilance, the blues are effective at expelling yellow sneaker males from their territory, but are easily outcompeted by the much more aggressive orange males. You can read a detailed first-person account of interactions between the three types of males on <a href='http://archive.fo/Tws0l'>Sinervo's lab website</a>.</p><p>In short, we have a rock-paper-scissors situation: orange beats blue which beats yellow which beats orange. As a result, the frequency of each color morph oscillates in 4-6 year cycles.</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img style="max-width:50%" src="/blog/img/lizards/lizard-cycle.svg?sanitize=true" alt="lizard cycle" /> </figure></p><p>Similar dynamics were also found in <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/nature00823'>bacteria</a> and among <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/2460201'>coral reef fauna</a>; they may provide a possible solution to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox&#95;of&#95;the&#95;plankton'>plankton paradox</a>. The side-blotched lizard, however, is the most spectacular example, such that when John Maynard Smith, the originator of evolutionary game theory, had learned of <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/380240a0'>the discovery</a> of rock-paper-scissor dynamics in this species, he exclaimed: "They have read my book!"</p><h4 id="the&#95;replicator&#95;equation">The Replicator Equation</h4><p>We start with a payoff matrix. As this is merely a teaching example, I use the standard payoff matrix for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, except I follow <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Theory-Games-Maynard-Smith/dp/0521288843'>Maynard Smith</a> and place <code>$\varepsilon$</code> on the diagonal, which is some small number. Otherwise I use the notation in <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Game-Theory-Action-Introduction-Evolutionary/dp/0691167656'>Schecter and Gintis'</a> book through which I found out about these lizards.</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/lizards/table-rps.svg?sanitize=true" alt="rps matrix" /> </figure></p><p>If you are familiar with game theory as used in economics, you may notice that the format is slightly different&mdash;instead of tuples, I use single numbers to denote payoffs. This is because the game is <i>symmetric</i> and it does not matter who the player is&mdash;all individuals are assumed to belong to the same population. All payoffs are shown with respect to the row player (player-1).</p><p>Now we get to the interesting part. We want to model the dynamics of player-1 playing a <i>pure</i> strategy against a <i>mixed</i> one labeled <code>$\sigma$</code>. The idea is that player-1 cannot modify his own strategy in response to the opponent (this should make sense, as the strategy is genetically determined) except as a part of a well-defined process (which corresponds to reproduction and natural selection) that I will describe in a bit. The opponent (player-2) has a mixed strategy because he represents the rest of the population. Assuming that the proportions of individuals in the population playing strategies O, Y, and B are <code>$p&#95;1$</code>, <code>$p&#95;2$</code>, and <code>$p&#95;3$</code> respectively, we get the following payoffs for player-1 against the population:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} \pi&#95;1(O, \sigma) &=& &#92;varepsilon p&#95;1 - p&#95;2 + p&#95;3 &#92;&#92; \pi&#95;1(Y, \sigma) &=& p&#95;1 + &#92;varepsilon p&#95;2 - p&#95;3 &#92;&#92; \pi&#95;1(B, \sigma) &=& -p&#95;1 + p&#95;2 + &#92;varepsilon p&#95;3 \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>The payoff for the population strategy played against itself is simply:</p><p>$$\begin{equation} \pi&#95;1(\sigma, \sigma) = p&#95;1 \pi&#95;1(O, \sigma) + p&#95;2 \pi&#95;1(Y, \sigma) + p&#95;3 \pi&#95;1(B, \sigma) \tag{1} \end{equation}$$</p><p>When <code>$\varepsilon=0$</code>, the expression above will be equal to zero. However, playing the population strategy against itself need not always result in a zero payoff (for example, the entire population could be growing). So we are interested in the <i>difference</i> between the pure strategy payoffs (played against the population strategy) and the population strategy played against itself. In an animal population, this differential payoff should affect reproduction rate. When it is equal to zero, the individuals playing the given pure strategy <code>$s&#95;i$</code> should remain at a constant frequency in the population. Furthermore, the rate of increase in the frequency of those individuals should be proportional to the frequency itself. Thus, we obtain the general form of the <i>replicator equation</i> which describes the speed at which the frequency of pure strategists <code>$p&#95;i$</code> is growing with respect to the rest of the population:</p><p>$$\begin{equation} \dot{p}&#95;i = [\pi&#95;1(s&#95;i, \sigma) - \pi&#95;1(\sigma, \sigma)] p&#95;i,\quad i=1, \ldots, n. \tag{2} \end{equation}$$</p><p>This is an important equation in evolutionary dynamics with <a href='https://doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.2002.3112'>a connection</a> to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized&#95;Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra&#95;equation'>generalized Lotka-Volterra equation</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price&#95;equation'>Price equation</a>. To apply it to our case, simply replace <code>$s&#95;i$</code> with the pure strategy we are interested in. When <code>$\varepsilon \neq 0$</code>, performing the appropriate substitution in the replicator equation results in a long and boring expression, which I will not show here. Instead, I will assume that <code>$\varepsilon=0$</code> when calculating the replicator system:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} \dot{p}&#95;1 = (p&#95;3 - p&#95;2) p&#95;1 &#92;&#92; \dot{p}&#95;2 = (p&#95;1 - p&#95;3) p&#95;2 &#92;&#92; \dot{p}&#95;3 = (p&#95;2 - p&#95;1) p&#95;3 \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>Since we know that <code>$p&#95;1 + p&#95;2 + p&#95;3 = 1$</code>, we can get rid of the third equation, after which we have:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} \dot{p}&#95;1 = (1 - p&#95;1 - 2p&#95;2) p&#95;1 \label{eq-x}\tag{3a} &#92;&#92; \dot{p}&#95;2 = (2p&#95;1 + p&#95;2 - 1) p&#95;2 \label{eq-y}\tag{3b} \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>Setting the above expressions to zero and solving the system, we find four possible solutions: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1/3, 1/3). These correspond to rest points (equilibria) where the speed of evolutionary change is exactly zero. These solutions are not necessarily what we are interested in, however, which is <i>evolutionarily stable strategy</i>.</p><h4 id="evolutionarily&#95;stable&#95;strategy">Evolutionarily Stable Strategy</h4><p>The evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a refinement of Nash equilibrium with stricter conditions. Traditional game theory is interested in situations when a player can rationally modify her strategy based on some guess about the opponent. The formal definition of Nash equilibrium is: given two strategies <code>$s&#95;i$</code> and <code>$s&#95;j$</code>, the pair <code>$&#40;s&#95;i, s&#95;j&#41;$</code> is a Nash equilibrium iff:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} \pi&#95;1(s&#95;i, s&#95;j) &\geq& \pi&#95;1(s&#95;k, s&#95;j),\quad \forall k \in ｛1,\ldots,n｝\tag{4a} &#92;&#92; \pi&#95;2(s&#95;i, s&#95;j) &\geq& \pi&#95;2(s&#95;i, s&#95;k),\quad \forall k \in ｛1,\ldots,m｝\tag{4b} \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>By contrast, evolutionary game theory assumes the players are not rational and is interested in accounting for cases when a small random deviation from the equilibrium (due to genetic drift, for example) leads the population to adopt an alternative strategy (which in biological terms would be equivalent to a mutant invasion). The formal definition of ESS is: a strategy <code>$s&#95;i$</code> is an ESS iff there exists some <code>$\delta \in \left&#93;0,1\right&#91;$</code> s.t. <code>$ \forall \epsilon: 0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; \delta$</code> and <code>$ \forall k \in ｛1,\ldots,n｝, k \neq i$</code>,</p><p>$$\begin{equation} \pi[s&#95;i, (1-\epsilon)s&#95;i + \epsilon s&#95;k] > \pi[s&#95;k, (1-\epsilon)s&#95;i + \epsilon s&#95;k]. \label{ess-def}\tag{5} \end{equation}$$</p><p>In practice, this means several things. First, all ESS are Nash equilibria, but not all Nash equilibria are ESS. Second, Nash equilibrium is defined as a best response against the other player, while ESS must also be a best response against itself. Third, an ESS must be strictly better than any alternative strategy. Finally, all of this implies that when a population is following an ESS, there is a force of natural selection acting against mutant strategies. This force can be visualized as a vector field created by the differential equations in the replicator system, for example <code>$\ref{eq-x}$</code> and <code>$\ref{eq-y}$</code>.</p><h4 id="plotting&#95;the&#95;course&#95;of&#95;evolution">Plotting the Course of Evolution</h4><p>The consequence of the definition of ESS given in <code>$\ref{ess-def}$</code> is that, in most cases, an ESS can be found by simply looking the plot of the vector field: the ESS will usually be a point where the arrows lead. Mathematica has a very good utility for making such plots called <code>StreamPlot</code>. I extended it slightly to make ternary diagrams for 3-strategy games (there is also a <a href='https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~whs/dynamo/'>third-party tool</a> for this but I was unhappy with its renderings so I created my own). Let's see what the corresponding diagrams for the Rock-Paper-Scissor game we analyzed above look like:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/lizards/fig2.svg?sanitize=true" alt="rock-paper-scissor games" /> </figure></p><p>On the left, I plotted the case with <code>$\varepsilon=0$</code> and on the right with <code>$\varepsilon=0.2$</code>. The colors show the speed of change of <code>$p&#95;1$</code>, which is the orange morph in the lizard example (red means <code>$p&#95;1$</code> is increasing and blue means it is decreasing). It turns out there is no ESS in either diagram. If, however, <code>$\varepsilon &lt; 0$</code> (not shown), then there is an ESS at (1/3, 1/3), which is at the center of the plot. For an analytical proof of the (non-)existence of ESS, see <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Game-Theory-Action-Introduction-Evolutionary/dp/0691167656'>Schecter and Gintis</a>. I like the Rock-Paper-Scissors game because it illustrates well the situation when there is a Nash equilibrium but not an ESS.</p><p>Now let's look at a more common way to visualize population dynamics (plotted for the case of <code>$\varepsilon = 0.1$</code>):</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img style="max-width:60%;" src="/blog/img/lizards/fig4.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Bad-RPS dynamics" /> </figure></p><p>If this seems vaguely similar to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, it is not coincidental&mdash;the replicator equation has a connection to a generalized version of that model.</p><p>What could be the biological meaning of <code>$\varepsilon$</code>? When this number is positive, it implies the fights that occur between members of the same color morph are less violent than between members of different color morphs (or perhaps individuals within the same color morph derive some other benefit from being around similar individuals). In other words, if <code>$\varepsilon&gt;0$</code>, then we have a weak form of <i>selective altruism</i> (what the father of gene-centrism W.D. Hamilton called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-beard&#95;effect'>green-beard effect</a>). It turns out that there indeed appears to exist a form of selective altruism among blue-throated males, which recognize each other from a distance and generally avoid aggressive fighting.</p><p>As we see from the model, selective altruism leads to ever-increasing cycles (that W.B. Yeats would probably call <a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming'>"the widening gyre"</a>), which will likely end in a disappearance of one of the color morphs (not necessarily the one that is selectively altruistic). Sinervo and others have confirmed that in some places in the range of this lizard species, one of the color morphs had gone extinct.</p><h3 id="other&#95;symmetric&#95;games">Other Symmetric Games</h3><p>For fun, I plotted some versions of the Hawk-Dove game analyzed by Maynard Smith in <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Theory-Games-Maynard-Smith/dp/0521288843'>Evolution and the Theory of Games</a>. On the left-hand diagram below, there is only one ESS (which should be easy to see), while on the right there are two ESS: pure Retaliator strategy and mixed (50-50) Hawk-Dove strategy:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/lizards/fig3.svg?sanitize=true" alt="other games" /> </figure></p><p>I will briefly explain the payoff matrices I entered to produce these diagrams. The original Hawk-Dove is a game with 2 strategies, but I extend it to a 3-strategy game by adding a 50-50 mixed strategy. The payoff matrix is shown below:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/lizards/table-mixed.svg?sanitize=true" alt="mixed matrix" /> </figure></p><p>In the original Hawk-Dove game, there are two strategies one can play (the labels refer to strategies, not species). A Hawk playing another Hawk always fights, which results in a significant cost (represented by -1) to each player. When playing against a Dove, the Hawk threatens to fight, and Dove always cedes the resource, hence Hawk gets 2 and Dove gets 0. Finally, two Doves playing against each other end up sharing the resource without fighting.</p><p>The payoffs in the "M" row (except the last cell) correspond to column averages of the values above (because mixed player chooses either strategy with 50% probability). The converse applies to the "M" column (except the last cell). Finally, the last cell is the average payoff a mixed player is expected to receive when playing another mixed player. This should be equal to the average of all payoffs in the original 2x2 matrix. Because we know that a mixed 50-50 strategy is an ESS for the 2x2 Hawk-Dove game, we also expect it to work in the extended 3x3 case, so it is not surprising that it does.</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/lizards/table-retaliator.svg?sanitize=true" alt="retaliator matrix" /> </figure></p><p>Above is the Hawk-Dove-Retaliator matrix. The 2x2 matrix is the same as in the previous game. The Retaliator is someone who can fight but (usually) chooses not to. Because Hawks always initiate a fight, the payoff for Retaliator playing against a Hawk is the same as for a Hawk playing against a Hawk. Now, the payoff for a Retaliator playing against a Dove should be 1, but that results in a boring game, so Maynard Smith modified it to be 1.1, meaning that <i>sometimes</i> the Retaliator wins against a Dove (who never fights). The same extra amount is then subtracted from the inverse case (when Dove plays Retaliator).</p><h3 id="last&#95;words">Last Words</h3><p>The lizard example is sometimes used in support of existence of genders among animals. But it is quite obvious that these are not genders but different male strategies. The yellow males easily out-reproduce orange ones under right conditions, which means their imitation of female rituals does not imply they want to copulate with orange males.</p><p>Another thing I wanted to make clear was that these lizards are an example of a population dynamic that doesn't have an ESS, hence the three morphs are constantly in flux. But most biological species have already converged on their optimal ESS and their populations (evolutionarily speaking) are relatively stable. In other words, just because other species don't behave this way doesn't imply that evolutionary game theory doesn't apply to them.</p><p>This concludes my first foray into game theory. I promised to write Part II on sexual selection, which I will in the next post.</p>
