    <h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Where do sex differences come from? The mechanistic differences (females give birth, males inseminate females) are no mystery, but why are there so many subtle differences? There is quite a few of them: morphological differences that arise at puberty, different behavioral predispositions, as well as the differences in prevalence, age of onset, and severity of <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2415' title='Ober et al. (2008)'>nearly all human diseases</a>. If you ask this question, you may hear mentions of chromosomes, gamete size, hormones, parental investment, etc. All of these have truth to them (in particular, <a href='http://roberttrivers.com/Robert_Trivers/Publications_files/Trivers%201972.pdf' title='Trivers (1972)'>parental investment</a> is a great way to predict how gender roles in a given species will map to human ones), but they also leave something lacking. The missing piece of the puzzle seems to be a causal explanation of what exactly drives so many subtle differences. One might say, “because females choose males to be this way,” yet though this answer is fairly close to the truth, it also misses something crucial&mdash;why would female choose males to be one way and not another? Why would this have any impact on human disease?</p><p>It turns out that fairly simple mathematics can help answer our question: many of the above-mentioned sex differences should stem from a fundamental asymmetry: females tend to be choosers, while males tend to be courters. In a <i>reproduction-survival trade-off</i>, the courters sacrifice some of their survival advantage to gain a reproductive advantage. One can equally say that <i>the choosers shift some of their genetic load onto the courters</i>. The male sex then evolves ways to suppress the genes that are harmful to it (resulting in <i>female-biased</i> genes), and to upregulate ones that increase its reproductive success (resulting in <i>male-biased</i> genes). Of course, females also evolve sex-specific regulatory mechanisms, but the asymmetry in reproductive success means this should happen more frequently in males. Because of differential expression triggered during development, a sizeable portion of the genome<a href='#fn-1' id='fnref1'><sup>1</sup></a> is recruited into this game&mdash;not just sex chromosomes. That chooser's advantage would lead to higher mutation load among male-biased genes may seem counterintuitive&mdash;naively one might expect that the party under more intense selection would cleanse itself of mutations. In this post, I explain why not only that does not happen, but the opposite rule holds.</p><p>Is this specific to mate choice? No, the reproduction-survival trade-off is more fundamental. It can lead to intrasexual competition as an alternative to pure mate choice&mdash;in fact, the former is more likely to arise. Intrasexual competition should cause similar mutation load imbalance to what we get under mate choice. The trade-off that a male peacock makes with his long tail is well known, but among <a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045769' title='Bro-Jørgensen (2012)'>bovids</a>, polygyny resulting mostly from intrasexual competition (as opposed to mate choice) is also linked to shorter male lifespan. There is another consequence of reproductive asymmetry: the courter may evolve ways to suit the chooser. These could range from something as common as fathers participating in parental care&mdash;to a more controversial idea I discuss below.</p><p>In a <a href='/blog/posts-output/2019-01-15-seger-paper/' title='A Classic Genetic Model of Sexual Selection (Part I)'>previous post</a>, I introduced the <i>two-locus model</i> of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherian_runaway' title='Wikipedia: Fisherian runaway'>runaway sexual selection</a>. Mark Kirkpatrick developed it to show that a gene which harms male survival but increases reproductive success due to preexisting female preference could sweep through a population, while also increasing the frequency of the female preference gene in the process. In this post, I reuse that model (following Seger and Trivers' paper) to show that, whenever <i>intralocus sexual conflict</i> exists (a gene variant benefits one sex but harms another), the choosy sex will tend to have an upper hand by shifting some of the burden onto the less choosy one. I also demonstrate that under evolution of traits linked with intrasexual competition ("war paint"), the asymmetry in mutation load should be identical. A Mathematica notebooks with code to produce the figures is available <a href='https://github.com/LocusOfCtrl/notebooks' title='Github.com: LocusOfCtrl/notebooks'>here</a>.</p><h3 id="asymmetry&#95;and&#95;conflict">Asymmetry and Conflict</h3><h4 id="the&#95;seger-trivers&#95;paper">The Seger-Trivers Paper</h4><p>In a 1985 book <cite><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Social-Evolution-Robert-Trivers/dp/080538507X' title='Social Evolution, p. 353'>Social Evolution</a></cite> (also available for free <a href='http://roberttrivers.com/SocialEvolution.pdf' title='Social Evolution (pdf)'>here</a>), Robert Trivers had proposed that sexual selection should make it easier for females to select genes for their daughters.<a href='#fn-2' id='fnref2'><sup>2</sup></a> In the following year, he developed this idea into a <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/319771a0' title='Seger and Trivers (1986)'>paper</a> (reprinted as <a href='http://roberttrivers.com/Robert_Trivers/Publications_files/libro_trivers.pdf' title='Natural Selection and Social Theory (pdf)'>Chapter 7</a> in <cite>Natural Selection and Social Theory</cite>) with his graduate student Jon Seger. The paper makes a two-fold claim: 1) that there is unequal pressure from natural selection on individual fitness when only one of the sexes is choosy, and 2) that selection should favor males evolving displays (or indicators) that let females maximize the fitness of their daughters.</p><p>The first claim was not entirely new&mdash;Russell Lande, in a famous but dry <a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1980.tb04817.x' title='Lande (1980)'>1980 paper</a>, already made an attempt to quantify the expected imbalance in genetic load between the two sexes. Most of the authors who cited Lande's paper, however, tended to focus on size dimorphism. The second claim, wholly due to Trivers, had gone almost unmentioned.<a href='#fn-3' id='fnref3'><sup>3</sup></a> One reason for its neglect could be that the mechanism proposed in the paper (selective diffusion) seems to be a weak force that that requires population structure and should be counterbalanced (even if partly) by the genetic interests of the male sex. Another reason could be the lack of a good animal example. In their paper, Seger and Trivers suggest that lower food availability on islands in the Caribbean (compared to the mainland) may favor those female <i>Anolis</i> lizards which prefer larger males. But an alternative explanation is plausible: lower predator pressure on the islands could increase the importance of intrasexual competition, which would increase male size.</p><p>Neither reason is good enough to ignore the hypothesis, in my opinion. The "good genes for daughters" idea points to a way in which <i>genic capture</i> could occur. Genic capture refers to the situation when an ornament becomes a reliable indicator of individual quality; it is accepted as the most likely explanation why mate choice persists long after all males have acquired the same ornament. In species where males do not participate in parental care, parasites should be a larger burden on females as they could transmit them to the young. It would make sense for females to be particularly concerned whether the males they mate with have any parasites, and, in turn, for males to evolve displays (such as the raised cloacal region surrounded by white feathers, as seen in the Black Grouse on the titular photo) that demonstrate their lack of parasites. Finally, a weaker form of the "good genes for daughters" hypothesis implies that sexual conflict is preferentially resolved in favor of choosers, which is something that should be empirically testable on laboratory models such as the fruit fly.</p><h4 id="the&#95;chooser's&#95;advantage">The Chooser's Advantage</h4><p>I will begin with Trivers&#8217; verbal model from <cite>Social Evolution</cite>:</p><blockquote><p> Imagine a gene in a female leading her to choose a male whose genes improve  her daughters&#8217; chance of surviving by 10%, while decreasing her sons&#8217;  survival by a similar amount. At first glance, genes for this kind of female  preference appear to be neutral in their evolutionary effects: what is gained  in daughters is lost in sons. But since the genes for this kind of female  choice will have increased in one generation among females, more females will  choose this way, giving a benefit to the males they prefer. (<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Social-Evolution-Robert-Trivers/dp/080538507X' title='Social Evolution, p. 353'>353</a>) </p></blockquote><p>Such a situation is incredibly common: a gene for smaller body size may be beneficial to a female (in helping her avoid predators) but detrimental to a male (who would be less successful in warding off rivals). Trivers' verbal model suggests that female body size should be, on average, closer to the species&#8217; optimum than male size. Similar logic can be applied not only to body size, but to almost any trait one can think of, including behavior. Note that if the gender roles were reversed (as is seen in a few bird species such as cassowary, phalarope, or jacana), then it is the females who would fall under a survival disadvantage.</p><p>This may seem clear enough, even trivial. Interestingly&mdash;and perhaps somewhat disconcertingly, the asymmetry in genetic load is blind to what the females actually prefer. It results from greater variance in male reproductive success, not from how females choose (if they choose at all). In the first two models I will discuss, such asymmetry is caused by mate choice. In the last one, it is caused by intrasexual competition linked to "war paint" displays. I show that both cases lead to the same genetic load asymmetry.</p><h4 id="adapting&#95;the&#95;two-locus&#95;model">Adapting the Two-Locus Model</h4><p>I already explained the two-locus model of trait-preference selection in a <a href='/blog/posts-output/2019-01-15-seger-paper/#basic_model' title='A Classic Genetic Model of Sexual Selection (Part I)'>previous post</a>, so I will not dwell as much on details. As before, we have a preference gene with alleles $P&#95;1$ and $P&#95;2$ (with frequencies $p&#95;1$ and $p&#95;2$) and a trait gene with alleles $T&#95;1$ and $T&#95;2$ (with frequencies $t&#95;1$ and $t&#95;2$). Unlike in the previous model, the trait gene affects survival of both males and females. The viabilities (survival rates) can range from 0 to 1 and are given in the following table:<code>$\def\sp{&#94;}$</code></p><p><figure class="matrix"></p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>T<sub>1</sub></th><th>T<sub>2</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Males</td><td>$\alpha&#95;1$</td><td>$\alpha&#95;2$</td></tr><tr><td>Females</td><td>$\beta&#95;1$</td><td>$\beta&#95;2$</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The fractions of $T&#95;2$ carriers among males and females that survive to maturity are:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} t&#95;2\sp{m} &=& \alpha&#95;2 t&#95;2 ⁄ (\alpha&#95;1 t&#95;1 + \alpha&#95;2 t&#95;2) \tag{1a} &#92;&#92; t&#95;2\sp{f} &=& \beta&#95;2 t&#95;2 ⁄ (\beta&#95;1 t&#95;1 + \beta&#95;2 t&#95;2), \tag{1b} \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>while the corresponding $T&#95;1$ fractions are simply $t&#95;1\sp{m} = 1 - t&#95;2\sp{m}$ and $t&#95;1\sp{f} = 1 - t&#95;2\sp{f}$. Using a method explained in the previous post, the frequencies of the two $T$ alleles in the next generation are determined as:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} t&#95;1' &=& (U&#95;{11} p&#95;1 + U&#95;{21} p&#95;2 + t&#95;1\sp{f}) ⁄ 2 \tag{2a} &#92;&#92; t&#95;2' &=& (U&#95;{12} p&#95;1 + U&#95;{22} p&#95;2 + t&#95;2\sp{f}) ⁄ 2, \tag{2b} \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>where $U&#95;{21}$ stands for the fraction of $P&#95;2$ females that mate with $T&#95;1$ males (and so on). Under the fixed-preference model of mate choice, the fractions of $P&#95;1$ and $P&#95;2$ females that mate with $T&#95;1$ and $T&#95;2$ males respectively are:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} U&#95;{11} &=& a&#95;1 t&#95;1\sp{m} ⁄ (t&#95;2\sp{m} + a&#95;1 t&#95;1\sp{m}) \tag{3a} &#92;&#92; U&#95;{22} &=& a&#95;2 t&#95;2\sp{m} ⁄ (t&#95;1\sp{m} + a&#95;2 t&#95;2\sp{m}), \tag{3b} \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>where $a&#95;1$ and $a&#95;2$ denote the degree of female bias towards the corresponding males (when $a&#95;2 = 3$, the ratio of $T&#95;2 : T&#95;1$ males that mate with $P&#95;2$ females is 3:1). The remaining fractions are simply $U&#95;{12} = 1 - U&#95;{11}$ and $U&#95;{21} = 1 - U&#95;{22}$.</p><p>Now that we have a complete model specification, we can do the algebra explained previously, set $a&#95;2=3$, selection coefficient to 0.4 and reproduce Figure 1 from Seger-Trivers paper (the color red means the fitness of $T&#95;2$ allele is higher than that of $T&#95;1$, blue means the opposite):</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;" id="fig1"> <img src="/blog/img/trivers1986/trivers-fig1.svg?sanitize=true" alt="figure 1 from paper" /> </figure></p><p>The left pane is the exactly the same as a figure from the <a href='/blog/posts-output/2019-01-15-seger-paper/#fig3' title='A Classic Genetic Model of Sexual Selection (Part I)'>previous post</a> with axes flipped. The right pane shows what happens when it is the $T&#95;2$ females (rather than $T&#95;2$ males) who suffer viability penalty, everything else being equal.</p><p>A geneticist would be interested in allele fixation, which on these plots happens where the reddish zone touches the upper border where $t&#95;2 = 1.0$. Note that in the right pane, the probability of fixation of $T&#95;2$ allele approaches zero, while in the left pane it is clearly non-zero (assuming a cryptic preference for this allele arises through some unrelated process). One can crudely approximate the chance of fixation by measuring the distance $\phi&#95;2$ from the point where equilibrium line touches $t&#95;2 = 1.0$ to the top-right corner where $p&#95;2 = 1.0$. We can find the closed-form expressions for this distance an plot it:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/trivers1986/trivers-fig3.svg?sanitize=true" alt="conditions of asymmetry (1)" /> </figure></p><p>The left pane shows the chance of fixation of $T&#95;1$ allele, while the right pane shows the chance of fixation of $T&#95;2$ allele (note that $\phi&#95;1$ and $\phi&#95;2$ are not technically probabilities, which is why I refer to them as "chance of fixation"). The blue line shows the situation when $T&#95;2$ males are penalized ($\alpha&#95;2 = 1 - s$), while the orange one when $T&#95;2$ females are penalized ($\beta&#95;2 = 1 - s$). We conclude that penalizing $T&#95;2$ males (compared to females) results in higher chance of fixation of either allele. Between $s=0.40$ and $s=0.67$ (right pane), there is a distinct discrepancy, however: penalizing $T&#95;2$ males still allows us to fixate the harmful $T&#95;2$ allele, while penalizing $T&#95;2$ females cannot result in fixation.</p><h4 id="a&#95;fully&#95;symmetric&#95;model">A Fully Symmetric Model</h4><p>Suppose now we make the model even more symmetric. Under condition A (blue line), the $T&#95;2$ allele reduces the survival of males while increasing that of females by the same amount. Under condition B (orange line), the same allele increases the survival of males while decreasing that of females. Furthermore, unlike in the previous models, the $P&#95;1$ females prefer $T&#95;1$ males instead of mating randomly, while the $P&#95;2$ females prefer $T&#95;2$ males to the same degree. Here is the result:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/trivers1986/trivers-fig4-sel.svg?sanitize=true" alt="conditions of asymmetry (2a)" /> </figure></p><p>The left pane shows chance of fixation of  $T&#95;2$ allele under the fixed-preference model, the right one under best-of-2 model detailed in the previous post. The X-axis is selection pressure. Unsurprisingly, the asymmetry (the delta between the blue and orange lines) increases with selection pressure. This effect is stronger under the best-of-2 model. Now if we make a similar figure for the degree of preference of females towards the respective male types ($a&#95;1 = a&#95;2  = a$ and $c&#95;1 = c&#95;2 = c$), we get:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/trivers1986/trivers-fig4-pref.svg?sanitize=true" alt="conditions of asymmetry (2b)" /> </figure></p><p>This is somewhat more surprising. As the degree of preference increases, the asymmetry decreases somewhat. A little bit of basic algebra gives us closed-form expressions for the deltas. If we set</p><p>$$ k = -\frac{(s-2) s\sp{3}}{(s-1)\sp{2}}, \tag{4} $$</p><p>which increases monotonically with $s$, then under fixed-preference model, $\Delta\phi&#95;2 = k a /(a\sp{2} - 1)$, and under best-of-2 model, $\Delta\phi&#95;2 = k/(2 c)$. It is obvious that the deltas are always positive when $a>1$ and $c>0$ and that their value declines as preference increases. Using this knowledge, we can construct a seemingly pathological case. Suppose $c&#95;1 = c&#95;2 = 0.4$ under the best-of-2 model. Then if we set $\alpha&#95;2 = \beta&#95;1 = 0.5$ (left pane) and $\alpha&#95;1 = \beta&#95;2 = 0.5$ (right pane), we get:</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/trivers1986/trivers-fig2.svg?sanitize=true" alt="a dramatic example of asymmetry" /> </figure></p><p>Although these plots are mirror images of each other, the story they tell is not symmetric. An allele that increases the survival of females by 2x while decreasing the survival of males by 2x can invade <i>together</i> with fairly moderate female preference for that allele from the point of origin (left pane). Meanwhile, the allele that decreases the survival of females by the same amount while increasing the survival of males cannot invade (note the arrow pointing down in the right pane). Furthermore, there is low but finite chance of fixation of alleles that hinders male survival, while there is no chance of fixation of the allele that hinders females even if it does arise due to cryptic female preference.</p><h4 id="the&#95;evolution&#95;of&#95;war&#95;paint">The Evolution of War Paint</h4><p>The first question that sprang to my mind after reproducing Seger-Trivers results was whether the same holds for other forms of sexual selection. Pure female choice-driven ornaments are probably fairly rare in nature (though the elaborate trains of peacocks and some other ornaments in birds from the <i>Phasianidae</i> family seem to be clear cases of it). A much more common type of ornament can be thought of as "war paint." Fisher described it thusly:</p><blockquote><p> As a propagandist the cock behaves as though he knew that it was advantageous  to impress the males as the females of his species, and a sprightly bearing with  fine feathers and triumphant song are quite as well adapted for war-propaganda  as for courtship. (<a href='https://archive.org/details/geneticaltheoryo031631mbp/page/n161' title='The Genetical Theory Of Natural Selection (1930)'>139</a>) </p></blockquote><p>A classic experiment on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfcGZCGdGVE' title='YouTube: Tinbergen&#8217;s Experiment'>stickleback</a> fish showed that the color red (a relatively inexpensive trait) may serve such a role in this species. The logic of the model is as follows: the $T&#95;2$ males are aggressive and also express some visual trait which is preferred by $P&#95;2$ females. The survival cost paid by the $T&#95;2$ males is dependent on the frequency of that allele in the population. When the frequency is low, fights are rare (because $T&#95;1$ males are not aggressive) and the ornament is not expensive, but as $T&#95;2$ frequency approaches 1, the survival cost approaches its maximum value (fighting off the aggressive $T&#95;2$ males is energetically expensive). For simplicity, I borrow the notation from the previous post. The frequency of the two alleles among males in the population is:</p><p>$$\begin{eqnarray} t&#95;1\sp{m} &=& t&#95;1 ⁄ M \tag{5a} &#92;&#92; t&#95;2\sp{m} &=& (1 - s t&#95;2) t&#95;2 ⁄ M, \tag{5b} \end{eqnarray}$$</p><p>where $M = t&#95;1 + (1 - s t&#95;2) t&#95;2$ is the average male viability. This is the only change needed to the model. I now plot the equivalent of the <a href='#fig1'>first figure</a>, with the left pane showing the fixed-preference model and the right pane showing the best-of-2 model (all variables are unchanged):</p><p><figure style="max-width:580px;"> <img src="/blog/img/trivers1986/warpaint.svg?sanitize=true" alt="war paint" /> </figure></p><p>As expected, the displays with frequency-dependent costs are much easier to evolve&mdash;hence we expect them to be more frequent in nature. Now what about asymmetry in chance of fixation and genetic load? It turns out we get exactly the same results as with the pure mate-choice ornament, that is $\Delta\phi&#95;2=k a /(a\sp{2}-1)$ under the fixed-preference model $\Delta\phi&#95;2 = k/(2 c)$ under the best-of-2 model.</p><h3 id="last&#95;words">Last Words</h3><p>The consequences of asymmetric choice may also apply to various seemingly irrational sociocultural phenomena&mdash;initiation rituals, body modification, fashion trends, and so on, though obviously these call for more dedicated models than what I present here. It is interesting to think how far the principle of genetic load increase due to artificial selection can be extended. Although we do not exchange any genes with dogs (hence sexual selection models are inappropriate here), almost all of the dog breeds we know today have significantly shorter lifespan than the wild ancestor of dog, the wolf.</p><p>The idea of selection optimizing mate choice to select "good genes for daughters" is an interesting one. The example with the Black Grouse I gave is by no means conclusive. Any actual support for the hypothesis would most likely come from experiments on fruit flies or a similar model organism,</p><p><hr class="hr-text"></p><ol class='footnotes'><li id='fn-1'>In <i>Drosophila</i> flies, male-biased genes show greater <a href='https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genet-120215-035429' title='Grath and Parsch (2016)'>inter-species diversity</a>, which indicates both greater mutational load and faster evolution of those sequences.
